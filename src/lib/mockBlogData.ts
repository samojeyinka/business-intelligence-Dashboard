      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Business Case for Sustainability</h2>
      
      <p>Contrary to outdated perspectives that view sustainability as a cost center, evidence increasingly shows that sustainable ventures enjoy:</p>
      
      <p><strong>Greater resilience</strong>: Sustainable business models are better equipped to navigate resource constraints, regulatory changes, and shifting consumer preferences.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Talent attraction and retention</strong>: Purpose-driven companies have a significant advantage in the competition for top talent, particularly among younger generations.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Access to growing markets</strong>: As consumers, businesses, and governments prioritize sustainability, new markets are emerging for solutions that address environmental and social challenges.</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Approaches</h2>
      
      <p>Building a sustainable venture requires intentionality from the earliest stages:</p>
      
      <p><strong>Problem selection</strong>: Choosing to solve problems that matter for people and planet creates natural alignment between impact and business success.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Circular design</strong>: Adopting circular economy principles in product and service design eliminates waste and creates new value streams.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Stakeholder governance</strong>: Implementing governance structures that consider the interests of all stakeholders—not just shareholders—leads to more balanced decision-making.</p>
      
      <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
      
      <p>As we face unprecedented environmental and social challenges, the ventures we build today will shape the world of tomorrow. By embedding sustainability into the DNA of these ventures, founders can create businesses that generate prosperity while contributing to a more just and sustainable future.</p>
      
      <p>This is not just about doing less harm—it's about actively doing more good through the power of entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
